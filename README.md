# 🚦 Traffic Light Control System with STM32F103RB  

## 📝 Overview  
This project implements a **traffic light control system** using the **STM32F103RB microcontroller**, designed with both **automatic** and **manual modes**. The system allows **adjustable timing** for **red**, **yellow**, and **green lights** through **button inputs**, with a **real-time display** on an integrated **LCD screen**.  

## 🔹 Features  
- 🕹️ **Automatic & Manual Modes**: Seamless switching between automated traffic flow and manual light control.  
- ⏱️ **Adjustable Timing**: Easily set red, yellow, and green light durations via button inputs.  
- 🖥️ **Real-time Display**: Integrated LCD shows the current light state and countdown timer.  
- 🧠 **STM32F103RB Microcontroller**: Efficient and reliable embedded control.  

## 🏗️ System Design  
- **Microcontroller**: STM32F103RB from the STM32 family.  
- **Inputs**: Push buttons for mode selection and timing adjustment.  
- **Outputs**: LEDs representing traffic lights and LCD for real-time information.  
- **Software**: Developed using **C** and **HAL libraries** for STM32.
